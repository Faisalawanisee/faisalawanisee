### Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am a seasoned web developer with over 13 years of experience in the field. Over the course of my career, I have worked on a wide range of web development projects, from simple websites to complex web applications.

My skills and expertise include front-end development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various JavaScript frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js. I am also proficient in back-end development using PHP, Python, Node.js, and various databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.

In addition to my technical skills, I have a strong understanding of user experience (UX) design principles and have worked closely with designers to ensure that the applications I build are not only functional but also user-friendly and visually appealing.

I have experience working with various project management tools such as Jira, Trello, and Asana, and I have collaborated with teams of developers, designers, and stakeholders to successfully deliver projects on time and within budget.

If you are interested in learning more about my work or would like to discuss a potential project, please feel free to reach out to me. I am always eager to connect with other developers and discuss new ideas and opportunities. Thank you for visiting my profile!
